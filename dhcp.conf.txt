##dhcpd.conf netbios node types
## The following is a list of netbios node types, for the ISC dhcp server (should be pertinent to any DHCP ## server though).
## These are the node types for netbios options:
## 1 = B-node, 2 = P-node, 4 =M-node, 8 = H-node

## NetBIOS name resolution mode – Description
### B-node – Uses IP broadcast messages to register and resolve NetBIOS names to IP addresses. Windows   ##2000–based computers can use modified B-node name resolution.
###P-node – Uses point-to-point communication with a NetBIOS name server (in Windows 2000–based networks, ##this is the WINS server) to register and resolve computer names to IP addresses.
###M-node – Uses a mix of B-node and P-node communication to register and resolve NetBIOS names. M-node ##first uses broadcast resolution; then, if necessary, it uses a server query.
###H-node – Uses a hybrid of B-node and P-node. An H-node computer always tries a server query first and ##uses broadcasts only if direct queries fail.
##Computers running Windows NT4 and higher use B-node name resolution by default and use H-node when ##configured with a WINS server.
##In order for remote NetBIOS names to be resolved, you must configure your computers running Windows NT4 ##(and later) with the IP address of a WINS server. You must configure Active Directory–enabled computers ##running Windows NT (and later) with the IP address of a WINS server if they are to communicate with ##computers running Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 95, or Windows 98 that are not Active Directory ##enabled.

# Hosts which require special configuration options can be listed in
# host statements.   If no address is specified, the address will be
# allocated dynamically (if possible), but the host-specific information
# will still come from the host declaration.

#host passacaglia {
#  hardware ethernet 0:0:c0:5d:bd:95;
#  filename "vmunix.passacaglia";
#  server-name "toccata.fugue.com";
#}

# Fixed IP addresses can also be specified for hosts.   These addresses
# should not also be listed as being available for dynamic assignment.
# Hosts for which fixed IP addresses have been specified can boot using
# BOOTP or DHCP.   Hosts for which no fixed address is specified can only
# be booted with DHCP, unless there is an address range on the subnet
# to which a BOOTP client is connected which has the dynamic-bootp flag
# set.
#host fantasia {
#  hardware ethernet 08:00:07:26:c0:a5;
#  fixed-address fantasia.fugue.com;
#}

# You can declare a class of clients and then do address allocation
# based on that.   The example below shows a case where all clients
# in a certain class get addresses on the 10.17.224/24 subnet, and all
# other clients get addresses on the 10.0.29/24 subnet.

#class "foo" {
#  match if substring (option vendor-class-identifier, 0, 4) = "SUNW";
#}

#shared-network 224-29 {
#  subnet 10.17.224.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
#    option routers rtr-224.example.org;
#  }
#  subnet 10.0.29.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
#    option routers rtr-29.example.org;
#  }
#  pool {
#    allow members of "foo";
#    range 10.17.224.10 10.17.224.250;
#  }
#  pool {
#    deny members of "foo";
#    range 10.0.29.10 10.0.29.230;
