PLEASE READ: don't email me to report bugs, unless you are sure it's a packaging bug. Not only is email not a good tool for tracking bugs, it also excludes anybody else from tracking or working on the issue. Please read the section "Debugging and reporting problems" below.

=============

Supported Ubuntu versions:
- 16.04 (xenial)
- 16.10 (yakkety)
- 17.04 (zesty)

=== Introduction ===
This PPA provides updated X (2D) and mesa (3D) free graphics drivers for radeon, intel and nvidia hardware. Updates packages provide:
 * OpenGL 4.5+ support and new OpenGL extensions: http://mesamatrix.net
 * packages built against llvm-3.9
 * gallium-nine support installed by default. Read the specific section below
 * VDPAU, OpenMAX IL Bellagio, VAAPI and XvMC Gallium3D accelerated video drivers (see below)
 * OpenCL support (mesa-opencl-icd package), including updated libclc
 * r600 LLVM compiler, enabled with R600_DEBUG=llvm env var
 * optional GLAMOR acceleration on radeon (>= r300), and nouveau drivers
 * i915 gallium driver replaces by default i915 classic driver
 * experimental ilo (intel) and virgl (virtio-gpu) gallium drivers (see below)

For more details check the changelogs.

=== Basic usage ===
See "Adding this PPA to your system" later on, or just do:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers
and update your Ubuntu with the package herein.

=== Using gallium-nine ===
Gallium-nine lets you run DirectX 9 games in a faster way, avoiding the inefficent translation of D3D9 calls to OpenGL. For more info see https://wiki.ixit.cz/d3d9
You need:
 * this PPA with gallium-nine enabled mesa
 * wine from this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~commendsarnex/+archive/ubuntu/winedri3
 * if you want to test latest nine dev tree, including support for debugging problem also add this ppa: https://launchpad.net/~oibaf/+archive/ubuntu/gallium-nine/
 * then to enable gallium-nine run winecfg and enable native DirectX 9 under Graphics tab

=== Using accelerated video ===
Supported VDPAU drivers: r300, r600, radeonsi, nouveau
Supported OpenMAX IL Bellagio drivers: r600, radeonsi
Supported VAAPI drivers: r600, radeonsi
Supported XvMC drivers: r600, nouveau

* First you need to install mesa-vdpau-drivers package:
sudo apt-get install mesa-vdpau-drivers

* Then to test the VDPAU driver with mpv use:
$ mpv --hwdec=vdpau yourvideofile

* To test the XvMC (e.g.) r600 driver edit the file /etc/X11/XvMCConfig and insert:
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/libXvMCr600.so
or, if you are on 32 bit:
/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dri/libXvMCr600.so

and restart the X server. Then to test it with mplayer:
mplayer -vo xvmc yourvideofile

=== Using alternative drivers ===
To use experimental ilo (intel) gallium driver add this in /etc/X11/xorg.conf:
Section "Device"
 Identifier "Device0"
 Driver "Intel"
 Option "DRI" "ilo"
EndSection

To run your OpenGL program (in this case glxgears -info) with non default drivers:
* classic i915 driver:
$ LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/usr/lib/dri-alternates glxgears -info
* gallium llvmpipe software render:
$ LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 glxgears -info
* old non-gallium software render:
$ LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH=/usr/lib/dri-alternates glxgears -info

=== Debugging and reporting problems ===
If you have some problem with the drivers try running the application from the command line and see if there are graphics related warnings. Also type dmesg to see if there are other related informations here.

If you get crashes install the relevant -dbg pacakges (libgl1-mesa-dri-dbg or libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental-dbg for 3D drivers and xserver-xorg-video-intel-dbg , xserver-xorg-video-nouveau-dbg or xserver-xorg-video-radeon-dbg for X drivers) and reproduce the crash with gdb. Example:
$ gdb glxgears
[...make your application crash and then get a backtrace with:]
(gdb) bt

If X.org crashes look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log (or /var/log/Xorg.0.log.old when a new X session is started after the crash).

With the gathered informations try searching at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/query.cgi (also try with google) if someone already reported a similar bug. If not you may want to report a new bug:
for 3D drivers bugs: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mesa
for X / 2D driver bugs: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=xorg
